# For estimation of lifetime from intensity code:

Input intensity Image:

Estimated lifetime Image: From CNN ML model (with autoencoder architecture): In the HSV format, where hue and value are mapped to lifetime and intensity respectively.

Target lifetime Image: In the HSV format, where hue and value are mapped to lifetime and intensity respectively.

# ML model:

Input dimensions are: 360x360 slices into 128x128 images
pass through the autoencoder with minimum latent space of 8x8 (in between convolutional layers the Batch-norm is enabled) and bring it back to original image dimension of 128x128 with 3 output channels (to represent the HSV format where hue and value are mapped to lifetime and intensity respectively). 
in the best model: The last layer is sigmoid
best input and output chunk size: 128x128
